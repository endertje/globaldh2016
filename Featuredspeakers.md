##(Global) Digital Humanities and Subalternity: Questions and Provocations

Digital archives of subalternity are being built in corporate media and popular culture and through philanthropy 2.0 - without proper investigation into subaltern histories and contexts or any form of subaltern participation.

If digital humanities is a scramble to digitize and organize information, the popular, commercial and NGO based renderings of the digital subaltern should matter very much for projects ranging from digital history collections, cultural archives and big data. Popular culture and media are indeed considered part of such informational archive but don’t always include commercial/marketing platforms that become used as representations of authentic subalternity even as in actuality they are selectively staged. Add to this mix the interactivity of web 2.0 and gamification and we have social justice projects that emerge in digital contexts in the hopes of connecting the haves and have-nots in digital giving and sharing. A central issue for my presentation is to ask –“What does it mean to build a humanities database of subaltern contemporary lives?” In an emerging formation of digital humanities that is strongly practice based and in which everything is about “data” which in turn is a capital asset, how do we raise the question of “the subaltern citizen”? Should we?

###Turbulent Flow: A Computational Model of World Literature

As the field of computational humanities has grown over the past decade, it has also begun to catch on in places other than English departments. Yet similar to how theoretical paradigms have moved through the US academy in the past, computational methods for the study of literature and culture appear to be spreading outward from English departments (where digital archives and tools have been more plentiful) to area studies and other departments (where scholars are again in the position of having to catch up). For the latter group, it has become increasingly important to ask whether these methods merely reinforce existing knowledge hierarchies, or if they offer new opportunities for comparative approaches. This paper reflects on this question by presenting one version of what a computationally inflected comparative approach might look like. Using the case of “stream of consciousness” technique, it shows how we might begin to model the diffusion of such global literary forms across languages, thus putting computational methods into deeper conversation with area studies concerns and problems of cultural difference. In addition, the paper insists that computation is not a means to an end, or to a single conception of world literature, but is a way to provide new perspective on existing models, both quantitative and qualitative, of how texts circulate in the world.
