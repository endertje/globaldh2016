This LOCUS will be held under the umbrella of the inaugural Global Digital Humanities Symposium.  This avenue for presentations and discussion seeks to address how the interdisciplinary practices of digital humanities and digital social science can and should speak to the global cultural record. 

We are seeking proposals up to 300 words for 7 minute presentations that engage with one or more of the following issues: 
How do digital methods and resources facilitate research and engagement with transnational cultures, histories, and communities?  
How does a digital medium work for or against local cultural knowledge practices? 
How is digital humanities and social science work influenced by and interact with the current geopolitical landscape? 
What are some challenges and solutions to working across linguistic, economic, and technological divides? 
What are the environmental impacts, concerns, and issues of digital research?  
How are local accents inflected in the practices and ethics of digital humanities and social science? 
We are especially receptive to hearing about works in progress relating to research, teaching, or any other type of work that addresses global digital humanities or digital social science. Proposals from students (undergraduate and graduate), faculty, and staff are encouraged equally.
