We're excited to announce the Global Digital Humanities Symposium at Michigan State University on April 8-9, 2016.

This two-day symposium will address how the interdisciplinary practices of digital humanities can and should speak to the global cultural record and the contemporary situation of our planet. Of particular interest is work relevant to or stemming from challenges in the Global South.

Mark April 8 and 9 down in your calendar and look out for more information about the symposium at the beginning of spring semester 2016.
