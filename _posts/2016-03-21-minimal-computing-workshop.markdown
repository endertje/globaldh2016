The Global Digital Humanities Symposium will begin with a workshop led by [Alex Gil](http://www.elotroalex.com/) 
on Minimal Computing, an important subfield of global digital humanities. The description of the workshop is below:

> In this talkshop we will immediately link digital humanities to critical theory by looking at 
> the production of our own knowledge within the context of global capitalism and environmental decay. 
> We will accomplish this by reducing the technological stack you can use for your own production to bare 
> minimums that you can both understand and command. We call this type of praxis (theory + making), minimal computing. 
> Specific technologies you will be introduced to: Terminal, Markdown, HTML/CSS, Pandoc, Jekyll & Github. 
> Bring your laptops (Macs & Linux preferred).
