<b>(Global) Digital Humanities and Subalternity: Questions and Provocations</b>

<p>Digital archives of subalternity are being built in corporate media and popular culture and through philanthropy 2.0 - without proper investigation into subaltern histories and contexts or any form of subaltern participation.</p>

<p>If digital humanities is a scramble to digitize and organize information, the popular, commercial and NGO based renderings of the digital subaltern should matter very much for projects ranging from digital history collections, cultural archives and big data. Popular culture and media are indeed considered part of such informational archive but don’t always include commercial/marketing platforms that become used as representations of authentic subalternity even as in actuality they are selectively staged. Add to this mix the interactivity of web 2.0 and gamification and we have social justice projects that emerge in digital contexts in the hopes of connecting the haves and have-nots in digital giving and sharing. A central issue for my presentation is to ask –“What does it mean to build a humanities database of subaltern contemporary lives?” In an emerging formation of digital humanities that is strongly practice based and in which everything is about “data” which in turn is a capital asset, how do we raise the question of “the subaltern citizen”? Should we?</p>

<b>Turbulent Flow: A Computational Model of World Literature</b>

<p>As the field of computational humanities has grown over the past decade, it has also begun to catch on in places other than English departments. Yet similar to how theoretical paradigms have moved through the US academy in the past, computational methods for the study of literature and culture appear to be spreading outward from English departments (where digital archives and tools have been more plentiful) to area studies and other departments (where scholars are again in the position of having to catch up). For the latter group, it has become increasingly important to ask whether these methods merely reinforce existing knowledge hierarchies, or if they offer new opportunities for comparative approaches. This paper reflects on this question by presenting one version of what a computationally inflected comparative approach might look like. Using the case of “stream of consciousness” technique, it shows how we might begin to model the diffusion of such global literary forms across languages, thus putting computational methods into deeper conversation with area studies concerns and problems of cultural difference. In addition, the paper insists that computation is not a means to an end, or to a single conception of world literature, but is a way to provide new perspective on existing models, both quantitative and qualitative, of how texts circulate in the world.</p>

<b>Minimal Computing and the Borders of the New Republic of Letters</b>

<p>How is humanistic knowledge in digital environments produced in the second decade of the 21st century? Who owns it? Who benefits from it? In this talk I will try to answer those questions by strategically collapsing the distinction between digital humanities, pirate libraries and private vendors. Given that we're not likely to like the answer I have to give, I will propose some possible responses to our current dispensation based on our experiences with plain text and minimal computing practices in some of our recent projects: the why (a performance of transnationality and minimality) and the how (static site generation and github). Through a reading of Ernesto Oroza's "Architecture of Necessity," I will further argue that minimal computing presents us with the ideal meeting point between form and use in a border-crossing humanities at the moment where we fight for the very conditions of our digital knowledge production.</p>
