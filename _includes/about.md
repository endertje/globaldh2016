##Global Digital Humanities Symposium at Michigan State University

###April 8-9, 2016 

Digital humanities has developed in a range of disciplines and locations across the globe. Initially emergent from initiatives in textual encoding, database building, or critiques of design and media cultures, the field is increasingly drawn together.  Present scholarship works at the intersections of what had been disparate approaches.  Much digital humanities scholarship is driven by an ethical commitment to preserve and broaden access to cultural materials.  The most engaged global DH scholarship values digital tools that enhance the capacity of scholarly critique to reflect a broad range of histories, as well as present geographical and cultural positions.  Projects that seek to bring grant resources from the West are often met with well-developed and challenging critiques emergent around the globe from communities deeply engaged in their own cultural preservation, as well as in building relationships with other similarly engaged scholars. This symposium, which will include an extended workshop and a mixture of presentation types, engages squarely with issues of power, access, and equity as they affect scholarship in the digital humanities.

The invited speakers and local presenters at this two-day symposium will address how the interdisciplinary practices of digital humanities can and should speak to the global cultural record and the contemporary situation of our planet.  Of particular interest is work relevant to or stemming from challenges in the Global South.  The symposium seeks to strengthen networks of exchange among DH scholars nationally and internationally.

Themes and topics of this symposium will include:

- the practice of digital humanities across linguistic, economic, and technological divides
- digital humanities in the light of current geopolitics
- the environmental impacts of digital humanities research
- the inflection of local accents in the practices and ethics of digital humanities
